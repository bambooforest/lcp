# Corpus managemanet

In LCP system you can manage two types of resources on your own: your groups and corpora attached to those groups.

You can create new groups and invite users to them, you can see all the groups you are member of and view corpora in your groups. This functionalities work in the same way through all LCP interfaces. You can also import new corpora into your projects using dedicated command tool (link to importer!).

## Groups

When creating a new group, you need to specify the group's name, the start and end dates of the project duration, and describe the purpose of the group.

After creating the group, you can manage permissions and invite people via email to join. Simply enter the email addresses separated by commas to invite individuals. After the user accepts your invitation, they will be listed under the "Users" section. From there, you can assign them admin rights or manage their active status by enabling or disabling their account. This feature empowers you to control access and collaborate effectively with team members.

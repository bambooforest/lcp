# Querying

To start querying, you need to select "Query" option from navigation bar at the top of the web page.

First you need to select the corpus you want to query and language. To write your query you will need to use DQD (Descriptive Query Definition) language. For DQD, a key concept was the Entity relationship (ER) model used for modeling data structures in software development, especially for database schemata. For corpora hosted by our infrastructure, the structure needs to be defined in terms of entities (plus their attributes and attribute types), and relations between them. [In detailed DQD documentation](dqd.md) you can find more information about how to make queries using DQD or how to translate CQP into DQD.
